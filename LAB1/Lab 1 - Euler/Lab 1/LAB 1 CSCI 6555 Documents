This Project use GLFW as based library.
I calculated all datas in two styles(Euler and quaterion) then pass to shader.

I put the data before it is initialized and then calculate the new interpolation each loop.

I read model from file, this file must be off format, and no "off" at begin. You can find a teapot.off file as example
